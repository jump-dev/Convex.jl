    norm(x::AbstractExpr, p::Real=2)

Computes the `p`-norm `‖x‖ₚ = (∑ᵢ |xᵢ|^p)^(1/p)` of a vector expression `x`.

This function uses specialized methods for `p=1, 2, Inf`. For `p > 1` otherwise,
this function uses the procedure documented at
[`rational_to_socp.pdf`](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl/raw/master/docs/supplementary/rational_to_socp.pdf),
based on the paper "Second-order cone programming" by F. Alizadeh and D. Goldfarb,
Mathematical Programming, Series B, 95:3-51, 2001.

!!! warning
    For versions of Convex.jl prior to v0.14.0, `norm` on a matrix expression returned
    the operator norm ([`opnorm`](@ref)), which matches Julia v0.6 behavior. This functionality
    was deprecated since Convex.jl v0.8.0, and has been removed. In the future,
    `norm(x, p)` will return `‖vec(x)‖ₚ`, matching the behavior of [`norm`](@ref)
    for numeric matrices.
