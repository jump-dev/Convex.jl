# Installation

Installing Convex.jl is a one step process. Open up Julia and type:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.update()
Pkg.add("Convex")
```

This does not install any solvers. If you don't have a solver installed
already, you will want to install a solver such as [SCS](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl)
by running:
```julia
Pkg.add("SCS")
```

To solve certain problems such as mixed integer programming problems you
will need to install another solver as well, such as
[HiGHS](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl).

If you wish to use other solvers, please read the section on [Solvers](@ref).
